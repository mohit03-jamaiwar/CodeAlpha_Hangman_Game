# CodeAlpha_Hangman_Game
This repository contains the code for a basic Hangman game. The game is entirely console-based and demonstrates fundamental Python programming concepts such as:
1. random module for selecting a word.
2. while loops for game control.
3. if-else statements for decision-making.
4. String and list operations for game logic.
